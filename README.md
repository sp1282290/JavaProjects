Hospital Management System â€“ Java, MySQL, JDBC

Developed a console-based Hospital Management System using Java and MySQL to manage patient records, doctor listings, and appointment bookings. Implemented features like adding/viewing patients, listing doctors, and booking appointments with date-based availability checks. Used JDBC for database connectivity and SQL for data manipulation. Focused on modular design with separate classes for core entities (Patient, Doctor, and main controller), ensuring clean and maintainable code. Ensured input validation, database consistency, and relational integrity using foreign keys and SQL constraints.
